                        On the 11th of December 2019, my family and I embarked on yet another cruise but this one found
                        us having to travel to Singapore. That morning, it seemed like magic because all of us were
                        awake at the same time, wanting to get ready as early as possible to catch our flight which left
                        at 10h00 a.m. We arrived on time and went to check in for our flight. The only sad part about
                        this trip was that my mother could not come due to unforeseen circumstances. We had a 7-hour
                        flight from South Africa to Dubai where our layover was 3 hours. We left Dubai and then headed
                        for Singapore, and arrived at 10h00 a.m. When we arrived, we took a taxi to our hotel to settle
                        in and unpack our bags.
                    </p>

                        After that, me and my brother took a walk around Singapore. It was very warm and humid, but we
                        really enjoyed ourselves. The following day we went to Universal Studios amusement park where we
                        spent the whole day riding rollercoasters, eating junk food, and going to the various
                        attractions that the park had in store, and at night they had their annual firework show. The
                        following morning, we went to the port to board our ship and as the same as the MSC cruise in my
                        previous blog, we were met with friendly smiles from the crew, and thus our journey began. Our
                        first stop was Kuala Lumpur which we reached the following day after the departure. Kuala Lumpur
                        was such a wonder to behold. We disembarked the ship and went to explore. We visited the iconic
                        Petronas Twin Towers, the tallest twin towers in the world and the bustling Chinatown district
                        which was one of my favourite activities in Kuala Lumpur. The second one was visiting the
                        Central Market. This bustling market is home to a wide variety of stalls selling everything from
                        souvenirs and handicrafts to food and clothing. I spent hours wandering through the market,
                        browsing the stalls, and trying delicious Malaysian food.
                    </p>
                    <p>After a day in Kuala Lumpur, we departed for Penang in Malaysia. While there are did a lot of
                        activities such as go-karting, which I won, visiting the Upside-down Museum and ended our day
                        with elephant riding. All too soon, it was time to say goodbye to Penang and return to the ship.
                        My family and I had an amazing time on our cruise, and we made memories that would last a
                        lifetime. As the ship sailed away, we promised to return to these beautiful cities someday.
