                        On the 26th of December, my family embarked on a 7-day cruise that will see us going to a little
                        island called Reunion Island and spending the new year in Mauritius. As we boarded the ship, we
                        were greeted by the friendly crew and a sea of smiling faces. We found our cabins and quickly
                        settled in, unpacking our bags, and getting ready for the adventure ahead. The first day we
                        spent just walking around the boat and seeing what it had in store for us. This boat had
                        everything from swimming pools to a club on the 12th floor to a casino and lounge on the bottom
                        floors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent the rest of the night in a teenage gathering area just playing games and talking to
                        people but then went to bed early because we had had a long trip to Durban where the cruise
                        departed. We spent the day following day on the sea and that day was the day that I met some
                        amazing people that I would later spend the whole cruise with.
                    </p>
                    <p>The following morning, the ship arrived at Réunion Island. My family and I disembarked and
                        eagerly explored the island's many wonders. We visited the Piton des Neiges, a dormant volcano
                        that offers breathtaking views of the island. You also hiked through the lush rainforests, swam
                        in crystal-clear waterfalls, and visited charming villages.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a fun-filled day spent on Reunion Island, it was time for us to sail to Mauritius. We
                        arrived in Mauritius on the 31st of December. When we arrived, we disembarked the ship with a
                        handful of guests to explore this beautiful island. We went to the Pamplemousses Botanical
                        Garden, and everything was just breathtaking. After that, we separated from the group and went
                        to the Port Louis market to do some shopping. As the night drew near, we returned to the ship
                        where we celebrated New Year’s on the deck of the ship as we saw the beautiful fireworks. The
                        next morning the ship departed Mauritius and headed back to South Africa, and we just looked
                        back at the island with feelings of not wanting the trip to end but as we all know, all good
                        things come to an end and all we have left are just memories that no one can never take away
                        from us.
